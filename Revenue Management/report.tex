\section{Introduction}
Introduction to talk about what we have learnt in class (Single Product DP) and how the model in the paper we have chosen is a generalizing from single to multi-products


\section{Related Work}
Optional, we might like to discuss other papers that might be related to the paper we are looking at, e.g. the 1997 paper Yiwei told us to look at.


\section{Multinomial Logit Model}
The model of course.


\section{Experiments}
If we manage to find time to run any experiments


\section{Discussions}
This is where we can add our comments and our inputs, how the model can be further improved or how we can find estimates for the solution. 


\section{Conclusions}
Closing conclusions, futher areas that can be explored and research opportunities (for Yiwei only haha).
