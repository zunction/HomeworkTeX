abstract = {In this article, we study the revenue management problem of multiproduct dynamic pricing in the retail industry. Given a fixed initial inventory and assortment, the retailer monitors the inventory and sets the price to affect the behavior of customer choices over a selling season. We consider the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model of customer choice over substitutes and formulate the problem of optimal dynamic pricing as an optimal stochastic intensity control problem. We derive the optimal dynamic pricing policy for the MNL model with a time-dependent customer arrival rate. Furthermore, we propose a real-time dynamic pricing (RTDP) procedure that provides on-line optimal dynamic pricing policies based on the estimation of total customer arrivals over the entire selling season. This method is realized by a simple integral transformation by which a time-inhomogeneous model is transformed to time-homogeneous with a constant customer arrival rate. A dynamic programming based numerical algorithm is presented to compute the optimal solutions and to demonstrate the robustness of the RTDP procedure.},

abstract = {A firm has inventories of a set of components that are used to produce a set of products. There is a finite horizon over which the firm can sell its products. Demand for each product is a stochastic point process with an intensity that is a function of the vector of prices for the products and the time at which these prices are offered. The problem is to price the finished products so as to maximize total expected revenue over the finite sales horizon. An upper bound on the optimal expected revenue is established by analyzing a deterministic version of the problem. The solution to the deterministic problem suggests two heuristics for the stochastic problem that are shown to be asymptotically optimal as the expected sales volume tends to infinity. Several applications of the model to network yield management are given. Numerical examples illustrate both the range of problems that can be modeled under this framework and the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics. The results provide several fundamental insights into the performance of yield management systems. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1997 INFORMS},
