%Explore Relational Reasoning using Relation Networks


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two

%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third

\section{Introduction}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Introduction to explain our interest in relational reasoning on QA task. 
%
%\item What are the current methods in text-based QA task. 
%\item Replication of the RN network with slight modifications: using universal sentence encoder (USE) instead of LSTMs to do sentence embedding and (if have time) adding attention to the network, since the relation obtained by $g_\theta(o_i,o_j,q)$ are weighted equally before feeding it into the $f_\phi$.
%\end{enumerate}

	Deep learning has made it possible to do classification of objects in images and translation of languages, often with incredible accuracy. This is achieved due to the ability of neural networks to pick out important patterns that are inconceivable to the human eye, from large quantities of labeled data. However, just being able to learn patterns is not sufficient as it is not the only ability associated to intelligence; reasoning is another essential ability \cite{Bottou2011} that separates humans from machines. Hence, in recent years there is much work on reasoning related research, like visual reasoning \cite{Johnson2017, Santoro2017} where the machine is able to give an answer given an image and a visual question about the image, and text-based question answering \cite{Santoro2017} where the machine is able to answer a question based on the earlier sentences given to it. 

%\textbf{(impact of embedding and model performances)	}

In this project, we focus on the text-based question answering task using relation network (RN) \cite{Santoro2017} on the bAbI dataset \cite{Weston2015}. RNs are networks that are designed based on relational reasoning, where its capacity to compute relations is baked into the architecture without having the neural network to learn it. 

For any neural approach for natural language processing, word and sentence embeddings are indispensible. They allow us to represent words and sentences whose original forms are strings, as vectors which then we can feed it into a artificial neural network. There are various ways to embed words, and while unsupervised representations have been the more commonly used approach, using the assumption that you can tell a word by the company it keeps, there is an increased focus on supervised representations and also multi-task learning of representations. In our project, we explore how different types of embeddings, in particular, how the traditional unsupervised representations compare up to representations obtained from multi-task learning.


%This is done by learning the relationships between each pair of objects using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), following which another MLP is used to predict the answer for the question 

%(short explanation on wat is RN - one line) 

%\textbf{(using both lstm and use)}

Our experiments involve using two different representations, the first one being the approach used by the original RN paper \cite{Santoro2017}, to embed the context and questions into sentence embeddings using LSTMs, and the other uses the universal sentence encoder (USE) \cite{Cer2018} to embed the context and questions into sentence embeddings. In the RN paper, sentence embeddings are  called objects which the RN is uses to learn the relation between them. We then compare the performance of different embeddings on RN for bAbI question answering task.


%Here, we use both LSTMs to produce objects, which are the basic units that are passed through the RN, we used the universal sentence encoder (USE) \cite{Cer2018} model to embed the sentences into the objects that are to be fed into the RN. In this project, we focus on task 2 of the bAbI task as it is one of the most commonly task failed, which we feel is due to its task design of requiring two supporting facts to arrive at the answer.



%Other works on Memory networks \cite{Weston2015a}, DNC, Sparse DNC

%\cite{Santoro2017} 

%However, there are some tasks that, considered simple to humans, may be difficult or even impossible for the neural networks to perform. One of that is reasoning, where one uses prior knowledge to attain new information. 
%
%For example, learning to reason that mother’s husband is same as father is something that is challenging for neural networks to do. Thus, giving neural networks the ability to reason will allow us to learn new information from the data that is not obtainable from pattern recognition. 
%
%Therefore, we would like to investigate how the relational reasoning module allows the neural network to exhibit relational reasoning and its performance on the test-based question answer dataset.

\section{Task}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Brief introduction to bAbI dataset and focus on task 2.

  \caption{Text based QA architecture. Contexts and questions are processed with an LSTM to produce a set of context and question embedding. Objects, colored yellow, red, and blue, are constructed using LSTMs or USE. The RN considers relations across all pairs of objects, conditioned on the question embedding, and integrates all these relations to answer the question. Our alternative approach substities the LSTM with the USE to produce the embeddings.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{bAbI}
The bAbI dataset is a pure text-based question answering (QA) dataset that contains a total of 20 tasks. Each task corresponds to a particular type of reasoning, such as deduction, induction and counting. Every question is associated with a set of supporting facts, which provides the context for the question being asked. An example ``Sandra picked up the football'' and ``Sandra went to the office'' support the question ``Where is the football?'', which we humans can arrive at an easy at the answer ``office''. A task is considered to be successfully passed if it attains an accuracy of 95\% or higher.


\subsection{Two Supporting Fact Task}
Task 2 of the bAbI tasks requires chaining of two or three supporting facts to answer the question. As such, to answer the question ``Where is the football?'', it has to possibly be able to link information from the sentences ``Mary moved to the bathroom'', ``Mary picked up the football there'' and ``Mary went back to the garden'' for it to conclude that the football is at the garden. This tasks makes it challenging for the neural network as it requires some form of memory for it to be able to link previously acquired knowledge to answer the question.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Overview of the original RN model, comment on the strength and weaknesses
\item Modifications to the RN model that will help improve the accuracy of the task. Motivations for the modifications.
\item (Optional) A paragraph on USE?

\item How long we take to train our model and the train/test accuracy, loss values etc. Use original RN paper as a guideline of what numbers to show.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Relation Network}
The RN is a neural network module which is designed to do relational reasoning. It is a composite function whose form is given by:
\begin{align}
RN(O) = f_\phi\left(\sum_{i,j}g_\theta(o_i,o_j)\right)\label{eq:RNform}
\end{align}
where the input is a set of ``objects'' $O=\{o_1,\ldots,o_n\}$, $o_i \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the $i^{\text{th}}$ object, and $f_\phi$ and $g_\theta$ are function with learnable parameters $\phi$ and $\theta$ respectively. $f_\phi$ and $g_\theta$ are mulit-layer perceptrons (MLP), where $g_\theta$ learns the relation between two given objects and $f_\phi$ maps the relations to one of the many possible answers. 

RNs take in objects as its input and do not explicitly operate on natural language

In their simplest form RNs operate on objects, and hence do not explicitly operate on images or natural language. A central contribution of this work is to demonstrate the flexibility with which relatively unstructured inputs, such as CNN or LSTM embeddings, can be considered as a set of objects for an RN. Although the RN expects object representations as input, the semantics of what an object is need not be specified. Our results below demonstrate that the learning process induces upstream processing, comprised of conventional neural network modules, to produce a set of useful “objects” from distributed representations.

In the original RN model by \cite{Santoro2017} for the bAbI task,  

In the model used by \cite{Santoro2017}, up to a maximum of 20 sentences in the support set was processed through a 32 unit LSTM to produce an object. The $g_{\theta}$ is a four-layer MLP which contains 256 units per layer, and takes as input all possible pairings of of the sentences in the support set, concatenated with the

\section{Results}

Example of results:
Our model succeeded on 18/20 tasks. Notably, it succeeded on the basic induction task (2.1\% total error), which proved difficult for the Sparse DNC (54\%), DNC (55.1\%), and EntNet (52.1\%). Also, our model did not catastrophically fail in any of the tasks: for the 2 tasks that it failed (the “two supporting facts”, and “three supporting facts” tasks), it missed the 95\% threshold by 3.1\% and 11.5\%, respectively. We also note that the model we evaluated was chosen based on overall performance on a withheld validation set, using a single seed. That is, we did not run multiple replicas with the best hyperparameter settings (as was done in other models, such as the Sparse DNC, which demonstrated performance fluctuations with a standard deviation of more than $\pm 3$ tasks passed for the best choice of hyperparameters).

\section{Submission of papers to NIPS 2018}

NIPS requires electronic submissions.  The electronic submission site
is
\begin{center}
  \url{https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NIPS2018/}
\end{center}

Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to NIPS 2018 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages
long, including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only
  acknowledgments and/or cited references} are allowed. Papers that
exceed eight pages of content (ignoring references) will not be
reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the
conference.

The margins in 2018 are the same as since 2007, which allow for
$\sim$$15\%$ more words in the paper compared to earlier years.

Authors are required to use the NIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable
at the NIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the
current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may
be grounds for rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for NIPS and other conference information are
available on the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.nips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+nips_2018.pdf+ contains these instructions and
illustrates the various formatting requirements your NIPS paper must
satisfy.

The only supported style file for NIPS 2018 is \verb+nips_2018.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{}
  2.09, Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+,
which creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a
preprint for submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will
not load the \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.

\paragraph{New preprint option for 2018}
If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv,
using the NIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will
create a nonanonymized version of your work with the text
``Preprint. Work in progress.''  in the footer. This version may be
distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do not} use the
\verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for papers
accepted to NIPS.

At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper
as they will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

The file \verb+nips_2018.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing
your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract,
and text of the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are
summarized in Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and
\ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas)
wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch
(9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of
11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and
will be selected for you by default.  Paragraphs are separated by
\nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold,
centered between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points
thick and the bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow
\nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and below the title to rules. All
pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each
name is centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's
name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author,
list both author and co-author side by side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper
nouns), flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
heading followed by 1\,em of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2018+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2018}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote,
indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a horizontal
rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure
captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
either black/white or in color.

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
number and title always appear before the table.  See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
  rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style
files.  In particular, do not modify the width or length of the
rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes
(except perhaps in the \textbf{References} section; see below). Please
note that pages should be numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
not, for example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
instructions to achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
  select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
  All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
  with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
  machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
  fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
  fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
  should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
\verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
\verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
will ask you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
\verb+\-+ command when necessary.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.

\section*{References}




References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level
heading for the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable
as long as you are consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font
size to \verb+small+ (9 point) when listing the references. {\bf
  Remember that you can use more than eight pages as long as the
  additional pages contain \emph{only} cited references.}
