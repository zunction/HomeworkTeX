# HomeworkTeX
Homework that are submitted in tex inhabit this repository. Do not disturb!!!


## Requirements
If you like to collaborate on assignments with me but have no knowledge of Git or github, below are some instructions that might be helpful for you.

- a Git is a version control system that allows multiple parties to collaborate on a single project/document (in this case the tex file) without ruining each other's version.

- github is a Dropbox like freemium which is able to do version control at the same time. You can signup for a github account [here](https://github.com/)

- to start collaborating the Git way, you will need a distribution of Git on your machine.
  - for Windows users I suggest getting the Git for Windows Portable [32bit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.10.1.windows.1/PortableGit-2.10.1-32-bit.7z.exe)/[64bit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.10.1.windows.1/PortableGit-2.10.1-64-bit.7z.exe)
  - for Mac users, one can do the installation by following the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


## How to Git?

Assuming that you have a github account and Git distribution on your machine we are ready to start!

*Cloning this repository*
```git
git clone https://github.com/zunction/HomeworkTeX *nameoffolder*

if `*nameoffolder*` is left empty, the folder name will be HomeworkTeX.
